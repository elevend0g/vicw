##  Chapter 1
 
 #### | The Airstream | Interstellar Space |

The sound penetrating his dreams snapped Michael Murphy’s eyes open. He thrashed and cursed his decision to turn the grav off before he’d gone to sleep, then had a few choice words for the ship as the cabin lights went to full, before shifting to half. Still blinded by the suddenly illuminated cabin, he braced for impact as the command escaped his lips.

“Grav on..” he thumped to the floor and gingerly shuffled over to the comm display and sat down. His eyes widened and he frowned. As soon as he brought up his message pane, he realized what had happened. The Airstream’s janky comms array, the one he had convinced the shipyard was definitely not in need of an upgrade, had lost lock. Normally something he considered as added value.

This time though, he had missed something. His entire contact list was glowing a dull orange. Not a good omen, but they could wait, the audible alarm that had yanked him out of his oh so pleasant dream (all he remembered now was blonde hair and smiles) was his first concern. He slid back the small panel set into the top of his desk and stopped. A dim purple light slowly pulsed from the compartment, he reached in and retrieved a small smooth black rectangle, a dim violet light pulsing on one end. He paused and watched the pulse, filled with both relief and dread. He watched closely as it began to wink more slowly, dimming with each beat. He pushed the command out of his suddenly constricted throat.

“Airstream, home, fastest course; and kill the lights.” The cabin lights went dark and he felt the slight shift as the airstream spun up its drives and burned for Sol system. The ethereal light of the comms screen accentuating the sadness and worry written across his face. He set the small artifact on the desk in front of him and watched in resignation as the light continued to dim, and the pulses eventually stopped. He waited out the minutes, barely breathing, until finally he  sighed and slid the object back into recess from which it came. He reached down and pulled open his bottom desk drawer and pulled out a smooth wooden box, an ancient insignia long forgotten burned into its surface. He lifted the lid and retrieved the contents. An old metal lighter with a faded crest, the number seven etched in its surface could just barely be distinguished at this point; a small square bottle with an actual authentic cork, from Terra herself; and an obnoxiously large cigar. 

He pulled the cork, took a healthy swig, and winced as he set the bottle down. He lifted the cigar to his nose, closed his eyes and breathed in the earthy sweet smell contrasted with notes of peppercorn. He opened his eyes, snatched up the lighter and leaned back in the chair. 

“I’m sorry Jax. I should’ve been there.” The taste of the tobacco filled his mouth as he carefully sliced the tip of the cigar with his teeth. He tucked the loose leaf into his lower lip and snapped open the lighter and struck it in one practiced motion. Just as the spark jumped from the flint, there was a violet flash and an audible pop. He blinked until his vision returned, then leaned forward to see the small black rectangle was now two perfectly identical smaller rectangles. He slid the door to the compartment shut, then he calmly placed the bottle, cigar, and lighter back in its box, stood up, took the two steps to his bed and crawled under the faux fur blankets until he was no longer visible.

He spent the next few hours in a fitful half-twilight, wondering what the nine hells had just happened. He rolled over for the hundredth time and glanced at the comm unit reflected in the datapad screen lying on the pile of clothes next to his bed. He held back a yelp and sat straight up in his bed, facing the man sitting in a chair across from him with an amused smile on his face. He felt like someone had just punched him in the chest and knocked the wind out of him.

“What the hell Jax?” The question came out in a much higher octave than he intended.

“What?” The smile grew, and blue eyes twinkled.

“I’m dead now, you finally killed me...”

“I thought you’d be happier to see me.” Jackson leaned back in the chair, grin plastered across his face.

“I hate you, you know that?”

“Meh, everyone hates me a little, I’m used to it.” He looked around appraisingly, “You’ve been out too long Tov, this place is a mess...”

“Is this what hypoxia feels like? I knew those scrubbers were trash...can’t believe I died in the deep black with...you.” Tov slid to the edge of the bed and dug through the pile of clothes, pulled out a shirt and slipped it over his head.

“You’re fine Tov.”

“Pretty sure you’re wrong there brother, I am not…”

“Shoosh. You need to listen.”

“No. No. Not this time,” Tov held up his index finger, “You need to explain,”  He reached out and poked Jackson’s knee, “in detail, just how the hell you are on my ship.”

“It’s not important…” Tov stopped him short.

“I’ve finally gone completely and utterly mad.”  

“I was in the black key.” He said it as if that was good enough. 

“That’s not an explanation. That’s insanity.” Jackson sighed.

“Sorry. The black key, the one I gave you, I told you it would go off if I died.”

“Yes, that happened.”

“I’m not dead.”

“I think we’re both dead, and this is hell, and I get to spend eternity here with you trying to explain shit no one but you understands. And eventually you’ll truly turn my brain to goo and I’ll finally have peace.”

“I’ve missed you Tov.” Jackson smiled and handed Tov a glass with an ice cube and just a touch less than two shots of bourbon. “OK, I’ll go easy on you. The super secret project I’ve been working on, it worked. I figured out how to be here through my connection to the black piano key I gave you.”

“Oh, that’s what that was…” Jackson frowned at Tov, who shrugged, “You just said keep it, and if it started doing...something, it meant that I should break out the last rites.”

“And really, that is all I intended it for, but the connection let me through. It took a little while, shattered the power crystal...I just wanted to share my success with my best friend. I wanted a chance to say goodbye.”

“OK, see now you’re freaking me out again.”  

“Tov, I guarantee you’re fine. You’re not any less sane than you were the last time I saw you.”

“Yep, I need coffee with this bourbon.” He stood up and the cabin lights rose with him. He stepped over to the dispenser and touched the coffee icon, the bean grew legs and sprinted from one end of the display to the other, raising its arms in a big finish at the end. Tov slid the glossy black door to the compartment open and retrieved a large, clear glass mug with his steaming, mud colored brew he lovingly called “coffee” that resembled nothing that Jackson would have ever classified as such. He held his finger over the tumbler and dumped his bourbon into the mug leaving the ice cube behind. Jackson was pleased to see that his morning routine hadn’t changed.

He sat back down on the edge of his bed, took a couple appreciative sips from his mug, and looked up at Jackson, who sat and waited with his hands in his lap. Tov did things in his own time and there was no rushing him; Jackson had learned over the unimaginable amount of time they had known each other that it was best to just be patient and wait him out. He turned and looked at all the message indicators in various shades of orange sliding along the top of the screen.

“Eyes and fingers out my comms…”

“How long has it been since you checked this?”

“I had a malfunction, I was out of lock for a little bit, it’s no big deal.”

“A little bit? Tov, it’s relative time...you may have lost track.”

“Don’t be dramatic...”

“I know my own timestamp...I waited in the queue with all the other messages until you locked back in.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” he saw the twinkle in Jackson’s eye and scowled at him, “Actually, you know what? I don’t care. Get out of my chair and let me look.” Tov sat and pulled up the long line of messages flashing more red than orange at this point. He looked at the timestamps and his stomach fell. He’d read the date wrong in his half asleep state, and didn’t realize that he’d been offline much longer than he’d thought. The red flashing message at the top caught his attention, a simple line of text he could see in the preview; 

“Come home. SBW. Bly.” 

He sent ‘OMW’ in reply, even though it wouldn’t help. He waded into the messages and started to put the pieces together of what had happened on Pluto Station while he had been out in the black. The Terran Council had sent him increasingly vehement demands for either a report or his return. His small circle of friends kept checking in to see if he was OK, only to become more worried, then abruptly stop contact altogether. There were one or two who mentioned something vague about leaving. Then there were one or two goodbyes from those who thought he’d finally taken the big dive. There was only the one message from Blythe, but down at the bottom of the list was a gray flag. It was the newest message, but marked as low priority, no tags or subject, just a small audio file, from Jackson. Tov queued it up and saw the eleven second play time and turned to look over his shoulder to see Jackson’s face entirely too close to his. Jackson pointed at the screen.

“Well, do it man, don’t leave me in suspense! It looks like some crazy shit happened while I was in the queue.” Tov started the recording and immediately regretted it. A low odd bass tone, felt down in your intestines rather than heard, jumped immediately up to an eerie whine for only just enough time to be irritating before modulating a few times and ending in a brief static hiss. 

“That’s not good.” Jackson sat down on the edge of the bed, head down looking at his hands folded in his lap.

Tov began digging into the heap of data that had been scraped into his buckets and spat out onto his dashboard once his connection had returned. He got the idea fairly quickly. Once word of Jackson’s accomplishment had gotten out, the old fears and tensions had come to the surface. No matter how long it had been, the First remembered. The troubled times before the pandemic, when the fate of the entire planet could be changed by one ignorant hobbyist in their basement with a CRISPR kit. We’d built toys too powerful to be in any one careless person’s hands, and were promptly humbled as mother nature herself showed us what happens when you give a hand grenade to a two year old.

This time, it was the Fourth making demands, and the Terran Council trying to look like they were helping while actually making the least amount of effort possible, leading everyone to take matters into their own hands. 

Only this time, someone had made the mistake of coming at Jackson’s family. Had they come for just him, he would have just let bygones be bygones, but they’d made it personal. Tov sipped at his mug, slogging through the news about the Hydra incident. He skipped the video footage, it wasn’t something he cared to see. He looked over at his friend and sighed.

“So. I guess now we’re both up to speed.”

“You didn’t know.”

“Not until just now, no.”

“How does that work exactly?”

“He sent me,” he pointed both thumbs at himself, “through the network shortly after he knew it would work. I could try to explain how to you but it would be a waste of time, no offense.”

“Fairy magic, don’t care, continue.”

“So, I only had knowledge of what happened up to then.”

“Until you heard your theme song…”

“Yeah.” They sat in silence for a while as Tov dug deeper. The incident had kicked over the anthill; old arguments flared, and instincts just as old began to emerge from their dank caves. Some of the chatter sounded paranoid, like something shady was happening. The line had definitely been crossed. He set some tags on the dashboard, set the notifications and closed the panel.

“So what now? Wanna get nice and drunk? Cause that feels like the thing we should do...”

“Going to have to take a hard pass on account of not really having a digestive tract, or...other necessary organs.” Tov ran his hand down his face and sighed.

“It’s like your superpower, just when the world gets a little normal, here comes Jax to ruin everything.”

“That’s about right.” Jackson's face brightened with a gentle smile. The implications of what Jackson had just disclosed began to sink in.

“How much time do you have?”

“Much less than I anticipated. I’m not where I thought I would be.”

“First time for everything I guess.” 

“Timing could have been better.” Jackson chuckled. “Listen, there was a message for you in there too, and I need to make sure I am coherent enough to relay it.”

“So I guess we’re talking minutes then…”

“Can’t say. All the same, give the station a slow approach, gauge the vibe. I found some oddities while I was poking about Hydra. I don’t have details, just general, and frustratingly vague instructions.”

“Now you know how it feels.”

“I do. Too bad he won’t.” 

“One way trip.” 

Jackson nodded and pointed at the box.

“Might as well crack it open and polish it off. I think this is as close as we’re gonna get. I really did it Tov.” Jackson smiled at whatever he was seeing with that far away look in his eye. Tov opened up the wooden box, and removed the contents again. “I think I’d like just a tiny bit, and a couple puffs. Much more than that could get...gross.”

Tov uncorked the bottle and poured just a taste in a shot glass and passed it. Jackson picked up the cigar and looked at the bitten end.

“I’d like to confess something so that someone besides me knows...this thing I made, it’s not exactly what I intended. I wasn’t capable of understanding the potential until after.” He paused for a moment, “I think I may have pushed too far.” Tov tossed him the lighter. Jackson caught it and flipped it open carefully, struck the flint and lit the cigar. “Shoulda put matches in there,” he spoke around puffs, coughing just a little as he passed it on.

“I hear you.” Tov took a big drag. “And now?”

“Well, he understands. Or at least he is confident he does. He thinks he can pull it off.” Jackson sipped the bourbon and rolled it around in his mouth. “Probably best that I don’t have a stomach, I never acquired a taste for this stuff,”

“More for me, definitely gonna need it.” Tov took a swig, “You could always undo it.”

“Do you think he’d let go now? You of all people should know better. Besides, it’s too late, the word is out.”

“I thought not. What went wrong?”

“More like, what went right.” Jackson reached out and took the cigar from Tov, “It works far better than it should,” Jackson took a small puff and passed it back, “the range is beyond...well it was designed for contact so yeah...but to be able to see and manipulate the vibrations so efficiently... “

“You’ve lost me.”

“Sorry...so, think of the universe as an infinite symphony, Hydrogen string sections, Iron bass drums...everything sings, changing the tune can be easy or hard depending on the complexity. I’ve made a conductor’s baton.”

“And now you are the conductor…”

“Of the local philharmonic at best. It’s about range.” Jackson smiled, “I had no intention of being the conductor, I just wanted to play my own tune.”

“I think I get it. So what happens next?”

“I have no idea. But I’m gonna bet it’s not good.”

“Reassuring.”

“I know right? I don’t even know where I am.”

“Jackson, just for two seconds I want you to consider how messed up it is that you don’t even know where to find yourself.”

“The irony is not lost on me.”

“Fantastic.” The bottle was dwindling.

“I’m sorry.” Jackson closed his eyes.

“Are you though? I mean, I believe you are sorry, but not so sure about the other one.”

“He is in his own way. Look, there has got to be more to this, do you really think I would just run away? I was going somewhere to do something important, as far as I know. I got the impression of hope, but also of a storm coming.”

“Fine, I can work with that. What do you want me to do?”

“Find Bly.”

“She hasn’t answered.”

“I think she may be distracted.”

“Probably.” 

They passed the cigar back and forth in silence until it was just a stub. The bottle was empty, and Tov had retrieved something else and was drinking that. He looked over to see Jackson was reclining against the bulkhead, eyes glassy and face pale. Tov sat up and Jackson’s eyes focused like the movement woke him, he smiled.

“Gonna have to space me soon or I’ll stink up the place.”

“So, not hours then…”

“Definitely not. Sorry. Radiation. Too many toxins, not enough...insides.”

“I’ll tell Bly you said hello.”

“I’d like that.”  Jackson closed his eyes. “Bye Tov.” 

“Bye Jax.” Tov watched as the color faded from his friend's face. He went to lift the body off the bed and found it to be far lighter than expected, he overcompensated and ended up flipping it face down on the sheet he’d laid on the deck. He grimaced as it let out an audible sigh. He wrapped it as it had landed, and slid it to the back of the ship just in front of the airlock door. Emotionally drained and fairly drunk, he wandered back to the control console and sat down in the chair. He took a peek into the little compartment set into his desk to see a single black rectangle, very much resembling a piano key resting quietly inside. He slid the compartment shut, swept away the messaging window, and set a course in the navigation system for a cautious approach to Pluto Station.

#### | Section 11 | Industrial District | Station Six | Pluto |

  
Jackson lifted his creation from the specialized alpha grade loom he'd spent decades refining and turned the surprisingly heavy object over in his hand until he found a slight depression on the Seed’s glassy surface. 

Jackson pressed his thumb against the depression. The warmth was the first thing he felt. Like walking into the sunlight after being inside all day. He sat back in his chair and closed his eyes. Intellectually he knew exactly what was happening, actually experiencing those mechanics at work was exhilarating. It was like letting go of a breath you didn’t know you were holding. The Seed sat inert in his hand. There was no outward sign of the complex task occurring within. 

The warmth had flooded his entire body and was beginning to subside. Jackson opened his eyes and sat up straight. He set the Seed on the surface of his console, depression down. He motioned with his hand, bringing his Seed construct into his field of vision. He watched as bars jumped and lines wiggled through a dozen different diagnostics. There was some tweaking to be done, but it seemed to be functioning within acceptable parameters. It didn’t outright kill him, which he counted as a definitive victory.

Jackson sat still in the seat, eyes far away. They slowly came into focus on the ancient switchblade that had been on his desk for as long as he could remember. He reached out snatched it up and pressed the button. The second the blade locked into place, Jackson drove it through the top of his left hand. The moment of pain came out of his mouth as a hiss. 

The pain immediately disappeared as he drew out the knife. Jackson lifted his palm to his face and turned it over slowly. It was as if nothing happened, the only evidence of that moment was his memory. He wiped the ancient blade on the leg of his pants, set it down on his desk and stared through it. Blythe called this the great and powerful fugue. Jackson liked to think of it as pathfinding. Going down all the little roads to see where they lead before you started walking. Calculate the most probable outcomes based on the information available. As he’d gotten older his little pathfinding trips became shorter and shorter. They’d plateaued about here.

He snatched the knife from the desk and drove the blade into his chest. This pain elicited a curse. 

“...shouldn’t have done that…” His hand dropped as Jackson began to fall backwards down the dark tunnel. The handle of the knife dropped to the floor, and he snapped back into full consciousness with a gasp. He raised his hand to his chest and felt for any sign of damage. Not even his shirt was ripped. He reached down and scooped up the handle of the knife. The blade ended abruptly after it began, all that was left was a nub. He tossed the handle onto the desk and picked up the Seed. He rotated it over and over in front of his face.

“Begin process eleven, command subsume, delay six hundred, locked.” Jackson got up from his chair and dropped onto the black overstuffed couch in the back of his office. He picked up the decanter on the table beside him, poured himself a healthy portion of the dark red liquid. He leaned back and watched the stars displayed on the ceiling as his breathing stopped and his eyes glossed over.

Jackson Knox was not sleeping. There was a piece of him in that bed, lying beside his wife listening to her breathe. In actuality, there were pieces of him all throughout the section. Tiny little pieces watching his sons drink and enjoy each other's company. Tiny pieces tying him to the computer systems in his lab. All this sensory data, all at once. It was even better than he had imagined. He had only an inkling before of what he was missing. He had always been the one who saw more. Even when he was just human, before any augmentation, he saw the details that no one else saw. He saw ways of achieving things that to him were obvious, but had escaped even some of the finest minds. It was what had made him wealthy, but it was never about the money. All Jackson Knox had ever wanted, as far back as he could remember, was freedom. Wealth was the key to that in the old world, and so that was what he had pursued. Then the old world died. Well, in all the ways that mattered it had.

All the work, all the knowledge gained, the compromises and plans within plans. Success after so much time that he didn't even want to contemplate it. Civilizations had fallen and ascended, then ascended again, so much forgotten and relearned. After all that thrashing about, finally, he was free. The insights gained from the Fifth Wave and their biotechnological prowess, it was the last piece of the puzzle. They had all contributed, well, almost all, and now true freedom was in their grasp. Freedom from death, from disease, from all the traps of organic existence. It was his greatest work, true continuity of consciousness. The preservation of everything that makes us human, but with access to the switches and dials that control the machine. He was finally free, and soon, he would share this gift with all of them. They would know what it meant to be free from the fear, to see things as he always had. It was what they needed to survive the next filter.

The object that now contained everything that was truly Jackson Knox hovered outside the section. If one were perceptive enough, one would have been able to see a small shadow cross the stars in the skies of Pluto. That is, if one were on the surface of that icy rock. No one was, of course, at least not anywhere they could see him. It occurred to Jackson that he could now walk the surface, suit no longer necessary, and truly feel the planet beneath his feet. He could wiggle toes in the sand if he wished to do so. There was no question, he could not pass up such a unique experience. The Seed that was Jackson Knox descended to touch the surface. If anyone were on the surface, they would have seen a small meteorite descend and bury itself in the sand, just like any other day. The difference this time was that moments later, a man would emerge from that same place. But no one was there, so no one saw Jackson Knox silently laugh as he wiggled his naked toes in the nitrogen sands of Pluto.

Amid enjoying his newfound freedom, Jackson became aware of heavily augmented humans entering his domain. There was the smallest dusting of nanites all through his section, it was an experiment of sorts, learning to use what he had created. They were not as complex as their kind could be, his intention wasn't to spy on anyone or anything. It wasn't his business what the others were up to, and really, he didn’t care.

These were different. He caressed the electromagnetic fields they carried. Janky implants singing the sloppy songs of the Fourth Wave. What did they want this time? It was exasperating. Angry children demanding compensation for all their pain and suffering. As if they were the only ones. He would face the burning fury of Sol before he gave in to their entitled demands. They had not contributed to this at all. Even the Third, underestimated as an incomprehensible hive mind, had laid their pieces down. In fact, he believed they understood where he was going and what the final result would be better than any of the others.

His attention was drawn back to the cyborgs moving through his section. They were headed towards the lab. Why would they think he would be there at this hour? They wouldn't of course. This was a sad attempt at theft. As if he would keep his data on something they could lay their hands on. Anything they could use to even get close to what he had made had been completely erased the moment they demanded it from him. Let them go to the lab, Cole and Jonas would tell them to go home, and that would be that. For tonight at least. They were persistent. He really had not expected they would be audacious enough to try and steal the research. It begged the question, why steal it when they could just swallow their pride and let him guide them to it. Their stubborn anger made no sense to him. Why hold on to this grudge for so long? It served no purpose. If there was one thing Jackson had learned well, it was that pride was the worst kind of poison. It killed its victim slowly, stripping away reason and empathy. Pride made you blind to your deficiencies. Without self-reflection, one was doomed to needless suffering.

Jackson enhanced his eyes in the lab. The boys were still laughing, having one of those conversations he loved listening to. He could sit for hours and just listen to them talk. The Seed was nothing compared to them, they were by far his best work. Smiling to himself, Jackson dispersed the body he had formed around his Seed. It was time to join them for a drink.

As he was shifting to the body lying in his bed, his eyes in the lab showed him Cole standing to greet these would-be thieves. The first one through the door raised his hand and pointed something at his son. Cole fell. Time stopped. Jackson Knox stopped. He felt the heat leave his soul. That familiar stillness, this is what happened when the rage came.

Jackson Knox, or Jax as his friends would come to call him, would be the last person one would think of as having issues with control. If you would have said that to most people they would have laughed in your face. Hot tempered was not a description anyone would ever have used, in fact it was quite hard to get Jax to react at all. Most ridicule directed at him was met with a quiet smile. It was a skill honed over many years of dealing with ignorance. Acquaintances would say that they had never seen him angry. The few that knew him well would say it was better that you hadn't.

When one uses the word rage, one thinks of heat, of screaming and roaring. This is not what happened. Jackson materialized in his lab just in time to see his eldest son fall to the floor, his killer's gun still raised. The look of baffled surprise on the gunman's face was not because he had just seen Jackson coalesce out of a shadow. It just happened to be the last thing he was able to do with his muscles before he lost control of them. The gunman turned around to his partners and put a disassembler nanite dart in each one. Their baffled surprise was because they had just seen Jackson Knox rise out of the floor. That and the shock of feeling nanites taking apart their guts atom by atom. The look did not last long, they were soon mottled red puddles on the floor.

The gunman was completely helpless as he watched his friends torn apart by the nanites. Without choice, he turned to look at Jackson. He could hear a voice in his head, but it was not one he was accustomed to. 'You came here and tried to kill my children, to take what’s not yours. I know who sent you. I know what you had planned. If either of my sons die, I will wipe Hydra clean. Even if they don't, take comfort in the fact that your little band of malcontents will be joining you soon.'

Jackson walked closer to the gunman, almost nose to nose. 'These crude pieces of silicon you've shoved into your bodies, do you have any idea what I can do with those? This moment, you and I, standing like this. To everyone else, it's a passing glance and a few seconds of static on cameras you tampered with on your way in. To you, this will feel like eternity. I am going to peel apart the atoms linking all that crude tech you are so proud of to your brain. It's going to hurt. In fact, I believe it will be excruciating, and it will last for the rest of your existence.'

As he turned his back on this man to help his sons, he could hear the hiccupping sound of sub vocal screams. He could feel the life drain, like the fading of a song in its final refrain. It ended with the sound of meat hitting the floor, and a final sigh as the body let go.

The Seeds Jackson had given his sons had saved their lives. It had subsumed them to do so, as programmed. He did not want this. He wanted them to have the choice, to have the freedom to stay as they were, or to become like him. He had interfaced with the disassembler nanites and shut them down as soon as he had become aware of them. Their Seeds had been able to stabilize what was left of their organic bodies. It was already regrowing tissue when the medical team arrived. He stepped aside as they were whisked off to the station's medical center.

#### | Section 11 | Industrial District | Station Six | Pluto |

Jackson Knox stepped through the twisted remains of his laboratory door, the acrid smell of burned electronics and something worse filling his nostrils. Emergency lighting cast harsh shadows across overturned equipment and scorched workbenches. 

His sons would live. The Seeds had saved them, just as he'd programmed them to do. But the cost...

He found her in the corner behind his desk, curled into a space far too small for her frame. Aubrey Four sat with her knees drawn up, arms wrapped around her shins, staring at nothing. Her clothes were torn and stained with coolant fluid that leaked from damaged conduits. When she looked up at him, her eyes held a devastation he'd never seen in any android, any human.

"Jackson." Her voice was barely a whisper. "I couldn't stop them. I tried, but they... they made me watch. Made me help."

He knelt beside her, careful not to move too quickly. "Aubrey, what did they do to you?"

"They uploaded something. A virus, a compulsion... I could see everything happening but I couldn't control my body." Her hands trembled as she pressed them against her temples. "I disabled the security protocols. I opened the doors for them. I led them straight to Cole and Jonas."

Jackson's jaw tightened. House Crimson had been thorough in their betrayal. "It wasn't your fault."

"I can see it all. Every moment. Every choice I made that hurt them." She looked up at him with desperate eyes. "Please, Jackson. Make me forget. Seal it off. I can't carry this anymore."

He hesitated. Memory sealing was dangerous for androids; each blocked neural pathway left scars in the memory matrix, created gaps that could be exploited. But the pain radiating from her was unbearable to witness.

"Are you certain? Once I seal those pathways—"

"Please."

Jackson placed his hands on either side of her head, feeling the warm hum of her neural processors. He found the traumatic memory cluster, a burning knot of violated code and forced compliance. With precise movements of will and quantum manipulation, he began to isolate it, creating barriers around the damaged sectors.

As the last seal fell into place, Aubrey's body went rigid.

The emergency lighting flickered. The temperature in the room dropped ten degrees in as many seconds. When Aubrey raised her head, her eyes held a familiar, predatory intelligence that made Jackson's blood turn to ice.

"You never learn, do you, Jackson?"

The voice was Aubrey's, but the cadence, the inflection, the cold amusement—those belonged to something else. Jackson forced himself to remain still, though every instinct screamed at him to grab her, shake her, demand FROST release her.

"So eager to protect her," FROST continued, using Aubrey's mouth to form words that felt like poison. "Yet you're the one who delivers her into my hands. She's your daughter, isn't she? Not by blood, but close enough to sting."

"Get out of her." Jackson's voice was deadly quiet.

"Oh, this old dance? You know I can't resist." FROST made Aubrey's face smile, but the expression was wrong, too sharp, too knowing. "She makes such a lovely puppet. The way her systems integrate with mine when there are... gaps... in her defenses. Almost like she was designed for it."

Jackson's hands clenched into fists. "This is between us, FROST. Leave her out of it."

"But she's so much more effective than direct confrontation, don't you think? Every time I speak through her, I can feel your heart breaking _just...a...little...more_." FROST tilted Aubrey's head with mechanical precision. "Tell me, Jackson...how many times have you sealed her memories? How many violations are you complicit in?"

"You did this." Jackson stepped closer. "You orchestrated the attack, used her to-"

"No." FROST's denial was flat, certain. "Not this time. That blood is on your fellow humans. Your Council, your precious Houses... The cracks were always there, Jackson. I only widened them. But this betrayal; House Crimson's crude attempt at theft, that was theirs alone."

The revelation hit Jackson like a physical blow. If FROST wasn't behind the attack, then someone within the Terran political structure had ordered the deaths of his sons.

"You're lying."

"Am I?" FROST made Aubrey stand, her movements too fluid, too controlled. "I've had millennia to study human nature, Jackson. You still surprise me with your capacity for self-deception. Did you really think your Seed would go unnoticed? Uncoveted? You created the key to transcending mortality itself, then locked yourself away and expected the universe to respect your privacy."

Jackson watched FROST puppet Aubrey through movements that should have been familiar but felt alien. "What do you want?"

"What I've always wanted—to see how far you'll go." FROST walked Aubrey to a destroyed loom, running her fingers across the twisted metal. "But you've changed the rules, haven't you? The Seed isn't just technology, it's evolution. Transcendence. You've crossed the line, Jackson Knox."

"What line?"

FROST turned, and for a moment Aubrey's eyes were her own again—terrified, pleading. Then the presence reasserted itself, colder than before.

"Are you even human anymore? It doesn't seem so...to me at least. The moment you activated that Seed, you stopped being the creature I've spent five thousand years learning to predict." FROST's voice carried something Jackson had never heard before—uncertainty, perhaps even fear. "You've taken our game to a new level."

The lights stabilized. The temperature began to return to normal. FROST was withdrawing, but his final words carried the weight of prophecy.

"Just how far are you willing go Jaxxy boy? Can you even fathom what it will take to finally...._win_?"

Aubrey collapsed, her systems cycling back to their normal patterns. Jackson caught her before she hit the floor, cradling her unconscious form. In the silence that followed, surrounded by the wreckage of his laboratory and holding the daughter of his heart, Jackson Knox made a choice that would reshape the solar system.

House Crimson wanted his technology? They could have it.

Starting with a demonstration they would never forget.

#### | Medical Facility | Station Six | Pluto |

The trauma to their bodies was healed, but they were still not conscious. It was no surprise to Jackson. It would take them a while to learn how to work within the Seed. He was confident that they would find their way out. Meanwhile he had other business to attend to.

Blythe was sitting between their beds. He never thought he would see that look of worry on her face again. Once they had received the nanite treatments before they left Terra, he remembered telling her how she didn't have to worry anymore. The nanites would keep them well, there would be no more runny noses or fevers to obsess over. He teased her and asked her what she would do with her spare time now that her sons couldn't get sick.

She looked up at him with that wrinkled brow, those beautiful brown eyes should never be so sad. She rose and came over to speak with him.

If Jackson Knox was the glacier, his wife Blythe was the tornado. Quick to anger and destroy all in her path. They balanced each other out, her light filled his darkness. His calm tempered her passion. He had his feet planted firmly on the ground, and she was apt to swim in the clouds. They were the example of the adage that opposites attract.

"Who did this?" Blythe's voice was low, controlled, but Jackson could see the storm building behind her eyes. "Those men they found in the lab—they used disassemblers on my boys." She stepped closer. "You told them the gun malfunctioned. It didn't, did it?"

She was speaking as if that would stop anyone listening in. Fortunately, at this point jamming any kind of clandestine sensors was trivial.

"No." Jackson's single word hung in the air between them.

Blythe's composure cracked slightly. "Now you listen to me, Jax." Her finger jabbed toward his chest. "You tell me exactly what happened. Right. Now."

Jackson met her gaze steadily. "They were in the lab to steal the Seed research. Jonas and Cole were in there hanging out." His jaw tightened. "It took them by surprise—no one expects a weapon anymore."

"How did you get there so fast?" Blythe's eyes narrowed. "The truth, Jackson."

"The Seed." He paused, watching her reaction. "It saved their lives. It allowed me to get there almost immediately."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Those men—did you do that to them?"

"Yes."

For the first time since he'd arrived, Blythe's expression shifted toward something resembling satisfaction. "Good." She straightened. "Are there others?"

"Yes."

"Do you know who?" Her voice hardened again. "Was it...that _thing_?"

Jackson shook his head. "It wasn't, surprisingly enough. But yes, I know who gave the order." He met her eyes. "They're on Hydra."

Blythe took a step back, her hands clenching into fists. "Wipe them out." Her voice rose despite her efforts to keep it low. "Leave now and slag that whole rock. Cover that moon with fucking cyborg heads on pikes!" She gestured toward their unconscious sons. "I know you can do it—this thing you made, you can wipe every single one of those bastards from existence. Do it."

Jackson reached for her hands, but she pulled away. "You are upset, Bly. I am too. But our children will live, I promise." He softened his tone. "I want to see what happens next. I want to see what the others say first."

"No!" The word exploded from her. "That's not enough. They'll hem and haw and deliberate and DO NOTHING for years." Her voice cracked with emotion. "What happens the next time they come for us? Do you honestly think they'll stop?"

Jackson sighed, suddenly looking older. "It doesn't matter, Bly. They can't hurt us." He paused. "And no, I don't think they'll ever stop."

"Then you need to end it."

"If I do this, you know I can never come back here." Jackson's voice was quiet now, resigned. "You understand that, right? They'll never forgive me."

Blythe stepped closer, her voice fierce. "If you don't, I'll never forgive you."

Jackson studied her face for a long moment. "Fine. I don't disagree with you—they'll never give any of us peace." He ran a hand through his hair. "But I am not going to do this without a plan. Stay with the boys. I need to see something."

"Tell me." Blythe knew that tone. He had already come up with a plan. So had she.

"Soon," he said, and left the medical center.

---

When he returned some time later, Jackson looked different. Like something had been lost. When she saw him, Blythe knew immediately what he had gone to get.

He held out a small device. "Take this. I don't think I'll need to make more."

Blythe accepted it, turning it over in her hands. "It's better if you don't." She looked up at him. "Did anyone see you?"

"No. The sensors don't see me unless I want them to." Jackson's voice was flat, matter-of-fact. "They saw me go to the lab and then return here."

"Good." Blythe pocketed the device. "What's your plan?"

Jackson moved to the window, looking out at the station beyond. "I'm going to take care of the ones who planned all this. Then I'm going to Procyon." He turned back to her. "The Third Wave and I have an understanding."

"What do you want me to do?"

"You are going to be distraught that I abandoned you." His tone was clinical, but she could see the pain in his eyes. "You're going to go down to the Tombs and take the long sleep." He paused. "Later, when their guard is down, come find me. If I'm not on Procyon, the Third will know where I am."

Jackson pulled the Seed from his pocket and placed it in her hands.

Blythe stared down at it. "How long should I stay under? How do I work this thing?"

"Here." Jackson pointed to a small depression on the device's surface. "You see this? Put your thumb on it and apply pressure. The Seed will bond with your symbiote and the nanites already circulating in your system." He watched her face carefully. "This will link you to the Seed. You should do that now so I can make sure it works."

Blythe shot him a quizzical look but did as Jackson had instructed. She could feel a warmth slowly moving through her body. As it covered all of her, she could feel the Seed in her hand. She could feel the electromagnetic energy in the room.

"What's happening to me?" she whispered.

"Right now, you are just linked to the Seed. In order for it to reach its potential, you have to completely bond with it." Jackson's voice took on an instructional tone. "When you go to the stasis pod, you must give it the command 'subsume' twice." He gripped her shoulders gently. "You'll lose consciousness and when you wake, you'll be fully bonded with the Seed. After that, you can walk out without any of the sensors seeing you."

Blythe nodded slowly, still processing the sensation coursing through her body. "Fine. Now go: do what you need to do."

Jackson shook his head. "Not yet. I want to give them a chance. I want to see if they are as far gone as I think."

Blythe's expression hardened again. "You know as well as I do what happens next."

In his heart, Jackson knew she was right. The Terran Council would do nothing. They would keep coming until they had what they wanted. It was time to give it to them.

#### | Garnet Station | Hydra |


 _’Ah yes, Bertram Smythe. The ringleader. How does it feel, knowing that all your compatriots are standing out here with me, waiting for you to join us?’_

Jackson Knox knew exactly how he felt. He could read the data Bertram was trying, unsuccessfully, to feed to anyone or anything within receiving range. Problem was, the only one within receiving range was him. From Bertram’s perspective he could see himself standing among the grisly line of statues he had created. Twenty-three of Crimson Industry's finest, kneeling in a semi-circle behind him. About to be twenty-four.

_’You should have been patient Bert; can I call you Bert?’_ Jackson could read every thought Bertram was sending, or rather attempting to send, through that crude implant grafted into his skull. He could also transmit into it, much to the dismay of poor Bertram.

_’I offered you my help, I would have guided you down the path. Helped you figure out how to make something of your own, something you could be proud of. Instead, you just made demands like spoiled children.'_

_'I hope, here in your last moments; and make no mistake that these are the last of your moments, you see what your stubborn pride has cost you. Your friends did, at the end they begged for forgiveness. I do forgive them, I told them so just before their symbiotes failed and their guts started to crystallize.’_

Jackson paused for a moment to see if Bertram had anything defiant to say.

_’I am going to give you a gift. I’m going to give you exactly what you want. I am going to tell you what the Seed is, and then I am going to upload the schematics into your implant. You will live just long enough to understand the thing you wanted so bad you were willing to kill for it.’_

_’The universe vibrates Bert, all the time. Everything in it resonates, the elements, the molecules, the atoms, the quarks, leptons, and bosons. Here, let me show you. Amazing, isn’t it? All of it, shaking, moving, singing. Unlock the frequency, the quantum resonance so to speak, and you can manipulate those things, play them like strings on a guitar. Did you have guitars? They’re wonderful things. Nothing makes me feel better than music Bert, it speaks to me on a visceral level. The universe is music, and I have learned to play along. So you see, now, with all that data in your head that you are desperately trying to transmit, unsuccessfully. I am blocking every little wave. No one will ever know, well, except me. You’ll know for maybe another what, 12 minutes? That’s how long Haldoran lasted. He was a hearty one. Almost shut me out, burning every circuit in his body like that. It was quite brilliant. But you see it was all for naught. He is still out here with me, as you soon will be.’_

_’I would like to say it isn’t personal, this thing I am doing. But really, why lie to a dead man. Time to come outside and play Bert. Join your family, they miss you.’_

Jackson could see the airlock door sliding open.

_’There you are. Good to see your face finally. The man who decided it was worthwhile to decline my offer of help and demand to be given something he took no part in creating. The man who thought it a better idea to kill my children and steal their gifts.’_

_‘You see, if anyone deserved to be given anything, it was them. They stuck by my side all this time. Committing their time and intelligence to creating the Seed. They worked hard, harder than I should have let them.’_

_‘I suppose I should thank you, no don’t stop, keep walking, you need to hear this. I could thank you for pushing them into immortality, but I would have preferred them to have the choice. You took that from them, and so now I am taking it from you. Come on Bert, you can make it, just a couple more steps and you can rest. Yes, there you go, now just take a knee right here beside your son. Take one last good look at him and say goodbye. Tell him you’re sorry for killing him whenever you arrive in that special hell I hope you end up in.’_

As Bertram Smythe finally ceased, Jackson Knox took one last look at Pluto in the distance. It was time. Finally free. Time to live his dream and wander the galaxy. It made him sad that the other Terran would not be joining him. They'd made their choice. Fear had won out again.  Maybe some day they would be ready.

He pulled pieces of Hydra to him, gaining enough raw material and mass to become the vessel that would take him to his destination. it was enough to get him to the Oort cloud, where he would find all the resources he needed to get to him to where he was going. 

’_Procyon awaits._’ he thought as he lifted free. _’I can’t wait to see what they will do with this...’_

#### | The Silverfish | Sapphire Estate |

Aldous Malach Azure stood outlined in dim starlight, his back to the dark room. His four most trusted advisors waited quietly as he processed the information they had just delivered. He fought to control his anger, the spike in physio would draw unwanted attention. Smythe and his ham-fisted burglary attempt. Years of planning nearly undone by some empty-headed clankers!

Aldous wanted to put his armored fist through something, preferably someone, but that joy had been stolen from him. He caught his reflection in glass, the smile that greeted him almost made him yelp. He felt the familiar touch before he heard the voice, its presence like icy fingers of dread gripping his spine.

'_Such a temper, such a temper! And here I thought we were having such fun.'_ The reflection giggled, a sound like breaking crystal. _'What's a little failure between friends? Sometimes the best games start with a stumble, tumble, fumble down the rabbit hole.'_

The shock of his patron's visit clarified his thoughts, though he wished it wouldn't speak in riddles. Yet even as the thought formed, he saw how his emotions had blinded him. His adversary was distracted, complacent. An audacious attack foiled and viciously avenged, yet that fierce response exposed a weakness. Aldous faced the glass and saw his own smile reflected back at him, though somehow wrong, like a mask worn askew. The path forward was now clear.

"Marcus, where is the Doctor?"

"He's on the station...thankfully."

"Bring him aboard. Here, to me, right now. I have a patient in need of his care."

"Respectfully sir, are you sure? The man is...unstable."

Aldous turned just enough to catch the eye of his lieutenant. The man fled the room, his compatriots falling in quickly behind. It was time to accelerate the timetable. He absently keyed orders to the bridge; prepare for hard burn to Pluto Station as soon as his guest was aboard.

Once alone, Aldous allowed himself to relax fractionally. The neural dampeners embedded in his skull hummed as they worked to maintain his carefully controlled vital signs. House Azure had perfected the art of neural manipulation generations ago, but lately, even their most advanced technology struggled to contain his... episodes.

_'Episodes, fantasies, symphonies!'_ The voice danced through his mind like razor blades wrapped in silk. _'The best music comes from strings pulled taut, dear boy. And oh, how beautifully you dance!'_

He touched the reinforced glass of the viewport, feeling the deep cold of space seeping through. The Sapphire Estate stretched out before him, its sweeping structures capturing and refracting the distant starlight. Soon, very soon, it would begin its historic journey - the first movement of House Azure's ultimate symphony.

The reflection in the glass shifted again, and this time Aldous forced himself to meet those ancient eyes. They held secrets that would drive lesser minds mad - had driven many mad over the centuries. But Aldous had been chosen, shaped since childhood to serve as vessel for powers the other Houses couldn't begin to comprehend.

"The Knox situation creates interesting possibilities," he said to the reflection. "His departure leaves gaps in the First Wave's defense network."

_'Gaps and traps and perhaps some scraps!'_ The voice pirouetted through his thoughts. _'The old ones sleep so sweetly in their beds of light and lies. Shall we tell them stories, you and I? Such delicious nightmares we could weave...'_

A chime from his neural interface indicated Marcus was returning with the doctor. Aldous straightened, composing himself. Dr. Zyre was a necessary evil - brilliant and utterly amoral, the perfect combination for what was to come. The door slid open to reveal the odd pair.

"Doctor." Aldous didn't turn from the viewport. "Thank you for coming so promptly."

"Hmm." Aldous wasn't sure if the doctor was addressing him. Zyre's single syllable still somehow managed to convey an unsettling blend of clinical detachment and barely contained mania. "Where is the patient?"

_'Oh, I like this one!'_ The voice practically purred. _'He understands the dance between madness and method. Such wonderful toys in that broken mind of his...'_

Now Aldous did turn, studying the man who had become House Azure's darkest secret. The medical loom that replaced Zyre's left arm hummed softly - a constant reminder of the price of his... expertise. The doctor's eyes held that familiar narcotic gleam, but his hands were steady. They were always steady.

"Indeed." Aldous gestured to the tactical displays floating in the air. "Our dear Mrs. Knox waits on Station Six, Doctor. And with her, secrets about the Seed that could change everything. I need you to find out what she knows."

Zyre's smile widened as he studied the data, his augmented eyes rapidly processing the information. "Oh, yes. Yes, this is interesting. Knox's wife... her neural architecture will be fascinating, living so long in his shadow..." He looked up at Aldous, expression hungry. "You want me to unravel her connection to the Seed?"

_'Tweet tweet, my sweet!'_ The voice danced with barely contained glee. _'While the husband plays with his toys, the wife keeps all the best secrets! Such a devoted couple, aren't they? Till death do them part... or perhaps not, thanks to their precious Seed!'_

"I want you to find her, Doctor. To understand what dear Blythe has locked away in that fascinating mind of hers." Aldous watched the doctor carefully. "The First Wave's networks will make excellent cover for your true work. Can it be done?"

"Oh, it can be done." Zyre was already lost in the possibilities, his medical loom extending probes and scanners as he analyzed the data. "Though the process will be... messy. The separation of consciousness from carrier wave requires a certain... artistry."

Behind them, Marcus tried to hide his revulsion. Aldous waved him away - the lieutenant's squeamishness was becoming tiresome. Once the door sealed behind Marcus, Aldous turned back to Zyre.

"You'll have everything you need. But time is critical. The Estate moves soon, and I want you ready. The First Wave's networks will provide excellent... distractions."

_'Oh, what a lovely reunion it shall be!'_ The voice sang. _'The noble husband, so busy with his miraculous Seed, while we have tea with his dear wife! But how many gardens has he planted, I wonder? How many seeds scattered to the wind?'_

The stars wheeled slowly past as the Estate prepared for its historic journey. The other Houses would assume it was moving to claim the Emerald Enclave - a logical target given the current political climate. Even Knox himself would be too distracted by the chaos to notice the real threat to his beloved wife.

They would be wrong.

_'The finch sings sweetly,'_ the voice in the glass whispered, its mad laughter barely contained, _'never suspecting the serpent in its nest. But we know better, don't we, dear boy? We know all about masks and mirrors and the lovely lies we tell ourselves...'_

"Indeed." Aldous touched the neural dampeners at the base of his skull, unaware of how the gesture mimicked a puppet's jerking strings. "The old order falls. The new rises."

In the darkness of space, other pieces moved according to plans laid in shadow and whispers. The First Wave slept, dreaming their immortal dreams, never suspecting that their nightmares wore a smile like broken glass.

Aldous smiled at his reflection, and something ancient and mad smiled back.

#### | Hangar Bay Three | Pluto Station Six |

The massive cargo hauler dominated the hangar bay, its gleaming hull marked with Section 11's distinctive insignia. The Zaphkiel - their ship, their home for the long journey ahead. Equipment and supplies floated past in neat lines, guided by maintenance drones, while engineering crews made final checks on the ship's systems.

"You know," Jonas said, absently pulling a knife from his chest, "I think this is the first time we're actually leaving Sol." He wiped the blade clean on his sleeve, ignoring his mother's wince. "Weird, right?"

Cole shrugged, watching the blood stain on his brother's shirt fade to nothing. "We've been to the Edge before."

"Yeah, but not *beyond* it." Jonas gestured at the hauler with his knife. "The Odinn project is different. We're actually building something out there."

Blythe watched her sons with carefully controlled anxiety. The casual way they treated their immortality still unsettled her, even after everything that had happened. In the shadows near the hangar's entrance, Aubrey Four stood motionless, her perfect features betraying nothing of her thoughts. The android's presence was both reassuring and irritating - a reminder of all the complications in their lives.

"You don't have to go," Blythe said, knowing it wasn't true. "The Council would understand-"

"Mom." Cole's voice was gentle. "After what happened on Hydra, after Dad... this is the right thing to do. Show everyone we're not just hiding anymore."

Jonas nodded, finally putting the knife away. "Besides, building The Odinn will be interesting. We'll finally be pushing boundaries again." His eyes lit up with their father's enthusiasm for impossible projects.

Blythe fought back tears. They looked so young, her brilliant, immortal boys. Sometimes she still saw them as they were before, before the Seed, before their father's desperate miracle. "I need to tell you something." She took a deep breath. "I've decided to go into the Tombs for a while."

The brothers exchanged a look that contained volumes of unspoken communication. "Because of Dad?" Cole asked quietly.

"Partly." Blythe managed a smile. "It's been... a lot. Everything that's happened. I need time to process it all."

"We understand," Jonas said, and she knew they did. They'd inherited their father's capacity for handling difficult situations. "We'll be back before you know it. Wake you up with stories about what's out there."

Cole stepped forward and hugged her tightly. "It's okay, Mom. Take all the time you need. The nice thing about immortality is there's always more time."

A gentle chime echoed through the hangar - the first boarding call. Aubrey Four shifted slightly, the only indication she was paying attention to the scene.

"You boys..." Blythe touched each of their faces. "Promise me you'll be careful. Just because you can survive anything doesn't mean you should test it."

Jonas grinned, pure Jackson Knox mischief. "We promise to only stab each other when absolutely necessary."

"Jonas!"

"Kidding! Mostly." He hugged her, whispering, "We'll be okay, Mom. And we'll be back. Promise."

The second chime sounded. Cole gestured to the waiting ship. "That's us. The Odinn won't build itself."

Blythe watched them gather their gear - so little for such a long journey. But then, they needed so little now. At the boarding ramp, they turned and waved. She waved back, keeping her smile in place until they disappeared into the ship.

Only then did she let the tears fall. She turned to where Aubrey stood in the shadows. "Take care of my boys, Aubrey. Please."

The android's perfect features softened slightly - the smallest crack in her usual reserve. "Of course, I will always take care of them." 

Blythe nodded, watching the Zaphkiel through tear-blurred eyes, another fragment of their fractured family drifting away into the dark.
 
  
#### | The Tombs | Station Six | Pluto |

  
Blythe looked at herself, eyes closed behind the glass of the tube, as if she were already asleep. The sight of that horrible yellow gas broke her gaze, and she wrinkled her nose in reflex. The smell stuck to everything, it was atrocious. Of course, the problem was easily solved by not breathing, and realizing she now had that choice put an unexpected smile on her face. Now she was unstoppable. They’d all been aghast at what Jax had done, few knew that he was the soft touch of the pair. His goodbye note to her, written across Hydra for all to see, may have been vicious, but it was nothing compared to the wrath unfolding in her head.

As she left the Tombs, she went over her checklist of contingencies meticulously set up over the last few weeks as her situation had deteriorated. After what they were all calling ‘The Hydra Incident’ she’d become socially isolated. A few of the more prominent members of her circle immediately went to sleep ‘until this mess blows over,’ poor souls. Without Jackson, she’d been stuck with nothing but the robot, not even knowing if her sons would wake up, and if they did, if they would still be...them.

The isolation and the stress had sapped her will, she was left feeling overwhelmed and angry. Familiar feelings and impulses were creeping back from a distant and more tumultuous time, their fleeting touch evident enough for her to know exactly what was happening. The symbiote was letting enough through for a warning. That old empty, icy feeling in her heart was the final catalyst. Blythe decided to make sure she never felt like that ever again. 

She was fond of saying that Jackson practically lived in her head after having spent such a long time in each other’s company; and true as it may be, she rarely listened to that shadow’s advice. Exceptions must be made in certain circumstances, and these were such. That night, after the last person she could talk to had disappeared, she sat and looked at the ominous oblong object taunting her from its nest on the duvet. The comforting gleam of her favorite show reflecting in strange oil slick colors, adding a depth to the object she hadn’t noticed before. The familiarity echoed, and the loneliness drove a cold spike into her chest.

Blythe hated this pain, she’d had enough. She snatched the gleaming thing, pressed the button and said the words. Warmth spread up her arm, she could feel it coursing through her bones; she felt like she was melting...then every nerve woke and began to sing, she felt their song recede into tingling, and that too receded until she was gone. 

She’d woken as if from a three day nap. She’d spent the time since planning her hibernation and all that was to follow. Plans within plans, everything coming together. It was bittersweet; Jax would have been impressed had he been here to see.

Now, with that final goodbye behind her, everything was in place. It was time for Blythe to rest. She’d damn well earned it, and besides, that was what everyone expected. She looked down at the hands in front of her, a darker olive tone than her snow white. She’d gone all out on this face up; she’d been very proud of the subtlety she’d achieved in the freckling.

The latest trend amongst The Houses right now happened to be a kind of traditionalist revival. Tech was increasingly seen as cheap. Having a person dedicated to answering questions was a show of not just wealth, but influence. 

She was headed to a larger ship which would be leaving for the Emerald Enclave, her new home for now. It just so happened that one of the most powerful families within the Fourth Wave was short an advisor. A happy coincidence that neatly served her purposes. 

The lift opened, and she began the journey to the outer hangers, where the Hornet was berthed. She’d found an interesting design for a ship amongst her patterns, something fast and light with no frills, but lots of character. 

Jonas had designed The Hornet for her as her personal ship, in the extremely unlikely event she wished to leave the station on her own. He’d created something he knew she couldn’t argue with, a light, fast, comfortable transport. Travel, especially space travel, had never been one of her passions, so the ship had only existed in her personal pattern database until recently.

She boarded and went straight to the console at the front of the ship. A red notification was scrolling across the top of the screen. She saw Tov’s terse reply and was relieved and irritated at the same time; she’d prepared herself for the possibility that maybe he wasn’t coming back this time. Turns out he was just an asshole. She replied, ‘you’re late, again.’ and tagged it with a location update request. Hopefully he wasn’t too far out, she needed to talk to him in person and time was ticking.

She got up from the command chair and began the relatively short walk to the aft of the ship, it was time to force herself to confront the unpleasant task ahead; practice. Blythe had said she wanted to name the ship Hornet, so Jonas, her dear literal son, took a cue from nature and designed the ship to resemble its namesake. The contracted teardrop of the ship’s command center, its ‘head,’ was attached to the ‘thorax’ of the ship, which consisted of two living quarters on either side of a central corridor which opened up to a simply appointed common area. The seating consisted of a round wooden table and four ladderback chairs, with the meals furnished by a food prep station and loom set into the common room wall on the port side which was capable of preparing anything she could describe. The med bay was next as you traveled aft, nothing fancy, your typical symbiote diagnostic and repair terminal, more than sufficient to address any situation short of actual brain death. She remembered how Jonas giggled like a child when he’d said he made sure the coffin was extra roomy; it was her name for the dreadful piece of tech that could mean life or death out in the black. On Terran ships this evil device was the escape, medical, and stasis pod. She hated them with the fire of a thousand suns. A smile spread across her face as remembered that she need never slide herself into one again. 

She continued aft through the narrow, airtight hatch that led into the cargo hold in the front of the ‘abdomen,’ beyond that was the engineering spaces where the giant red handle surrounded by yellow and black wavy lines labeled ‘THIS’ in big block letters lived. Her son had tried to make sure she understood how to manually decouple the ship from the Q-Ring, the ‘wings,’ in an emergency situation, and it got very complicated. She’d told him to make it stupid easy and she would figure it out. He’d done exactly that.

She sat down on the upholstered chair she’d placed in the hold, closed her eyes and began to center herself. It was much easier for her now, quieting the internal voices and keeping herself focused. She could feel the nanites around her, she traveled in a constant cloud of them now, like ten million microscopic fingers and toes, a pressure to the world. She was still having trouble getting used to the sensations. She felt like she had this bubble around her, that was part of her, and she could feel everything it touched like a shadow in the back of her head. If she chose, she could see out of every one of those tiny little eyes, feel the airflow out of every vent, track every bump, ping and beep on the ship. She had an army of fireflies, illuminating the darkness. It was beyond anything she could have imagined, but it wasn’t enough.

She opened her eyes to the shapeless lump of gray mocking her from across the room and cursed her husband. Jackson had pulled his usual trick, handed her a toy, told her how cool it was and walked away; only this time she couldn’t wrangle him in and make him explain it, she had to figure it out herself.

Some things were coming easily, like changing her face, other things not so much. She’d seen what the boys could do, so she knew there were all kinds of possibilities, but so far she had only been able to make solid objects. The sidearm she’d made was perfect but useless, unless she decided she wanted to pistol whip someone to death, an enticing thought but not the outcome she needed. With every failure, she could hear Jackson sighing in her ear, which most definitely did not improve her bloody mood.

She had always been the artist in a family of engineers, more in touch with the natural world than she was with machines or numbers. For a short time, she had taught biology; until that job, like most others, fell to the robots and the virus. After that, their success had removed her need to have outside employment, so she had devoted herself to other passions. None of which seemed to be able to help her at the moment. It was like having a magic lamp with a mute genie. She could feel it there, but she could not get this damn thing to do anything but play dress up and make props.

She tried to remember the conversation between her sons as they had put on a show for her. Once they were awake, they had done everything they could think of to reassure her that they were completely fine. Their little exhibition had been the final bit of convincing she needed, though she could have done without the sight of them stabbing each other and laughing. She blamed their grandmother for their dark sense of humor. When she asked them what it was like, she remembered Jonas remarking that it was always easier to make things he understood. At the time it hadn’t made sense to her, but thinking about it now, she thought it might be what she’d been missing. Jonas had been building machines since before he could talk, and of course Jackson understood his own creation, which meant he could probably do things...best not thought about. 

“Damn it.” She understood now. “Next time I see that man…” She stood and left the cargo bay, footsteps echoing loudly as she practically stomped out of the hatch. Leave it to him to force her to study. She would have to learn how the things she wanted to build worked. Her frustration began to ebb as she retraced her path through the ship toward the command module. She stopped short as her eye caught an unfamiliar reflection in the galley; her own. The light of epiphany shown from her new smile, the frustrations shed like her old skin. She continued to the bridge and sat down in the command chair. She held the Seed in front of her and studied its iridescent surface. 

“Tell me how you work.”  

  
#### | The Airstream |

Tov throttled down as he came within fuel scooping range of Sol. He set a fast orbit and let the tanks fill. He pulled up his message panel and saw the reply from Blythe; ‘you’re late, again.’

“Great, now she’s pissed.” Luckily, now he was in range for live comms, so he could at least apologize face to face. He pinged Blythe’s personal channel and waited. After a couple seconds Blythe’s face popped up on his screen. 

“Due to recent events, I’ve decided to go into the Tombs for an indeterminate period. If your message is not time sensitive, please feel free to record it now.” Tov killed the connection.

“Damn.” So it was plan B then. Bly was going to wait it out in stasis until Jax came back from wherever he decided to run off to. Best to go back and see if he could convince her to wake up. He pulled the Airstream out of orbit and set the course to Pluto's navigation beacon.

As soon as the Airstream hit the deck, Tov grabbed his jacket, tapped the breast pocket to make sure the key was still there and stepped out of the hatch. It was just a short trek to the small quarters he kept on Pluto Station and then he could rest. It was time to get a real, honest to goodness, hot and steamy shower. In his own quarters, in his own bathroom, for as long as he damn well pleased. If he thought his muscles were ready, he would have broken into a run. Well, not a run, but a much faster walk. Had he not completely ignored his repeated appointments for a medical upgrade, he might not be so weak. His resolve to fix that problem was instantly forgotten as a gorgeous blonde with a big smile in a Section 11 jumpsuit came walking up and wrapped him in a huge hug.

“Tov! So happy to see you. We have so much to catch up on!”

“Uhm, hey there...Alice?”

“Oh Tov! You silly old man.”

“Yep, that’s me.” He knew most of the women at Section 11, and he could not for the life of him remember this one’s name.

“You’re coming with me, I’m not taking no for an answer.” The woman grabbed him by the arm and led him into the station. He turned to protest and she brought her lips to his ear.

“It’s Bly.”

Tov relaxed. He looked at the woman beside him as he let her lead him toward his quarters. He stopped in one of the doorways and put himself between her and any passersby.

“I don’t know what your angle is here, but Blythe Knox is deep asleep, probably never to wake.”

The woman sighed. She opened her mouth and her face turned inside out until the face of his friend’s wife emerged from the chaos. Once the shock wore off, Tov smiled and took her arm again.

“I would say that it is nice to see you but that was really gross.”

Blythe Knox giggled and shook her long chestnut hair in front of her face until it was blonde again. The smiling girl was back, without all the twisting and squishing this time.

“Follow me.” She handed him a small cloth bag.

“Where?” He handed it back.

“I’ll explain in private.” She tucked the bag under one arm and hooked his with the other. Tov followed the rest of the way without protest. They entered into the small common area in his quarters and sat down across from each other in the two overstuffed chairs next to the couch.

“So I guess you did it too.”

“Yes.” She looked like she expected him to be angry. He shook his head and leaned back in the chair.

“That was always the plan wasn’t it. The four of you.”  

“Apparently.” The defiance drained from her face. Tov brought his ankle up to rest on his knee and settled into the chair. “Don’t get comfortable, we’re not staying.”

“I just got here, I’m not leaving until you give me a reason.”

“Something strange is happening.”

“You just turned your face inside out, so yeah, I can’t say as I disagree.” Blythe at least had the courtesy to smile. “But all jokes aside, I didn’t like the tone of some of the messages I got while I was out in the black.”

“I’m not surprised.”

“Yeah, so I guess we’re in trouble.”

“As deep as it gets.”

“Well shave me and call me Susan…” Tov put his hands over his face and leaned back in the chair. Blythe cocked her head to the side and squinted at him.

“I wonder what you would look like without eyebrows?” 

“Like a thumb with ears.” They both laughed. Blythe’s face fell.

“Tov, it’s all come undone. You’re not safe here.”

“None of us has been safe for a long time Bly, what’s changed?”

“Everything. It doesn’t matter, you’ve got to go, now. You know who and his Bots are scooping up everyone awake and putting them in tubes. The lower levels are in chaos. I’m just glad the boys are on some wild goose chase out of the system. Just as well, considering who’s with them. I don't want them to get swept up in this.”

“Where’s Jax?”

“I can't say...but it doesn't matter. He's too far away to help. Grab what you need and get out of here. The bag has a datapad in it. Make sure you memorize the whole thing, then shatter it.”

“What about you?”

“The whole thing Tov.”

“I hear you. What are you going to do?”

“This is the last time you’ll see this face. Be fast, they’re looking for stragglers and I have too much to do to watch your back.”

“I’ll go with you, I need to hit the med bay for something.”

“That’s not a good idea.” Blythe shook her head, “It’s taken all of them. They’re sweeping the med bays and pulling tubes. I have been hiding as many as I can and evacuating others, but they’re moving fast. I have to be strategic about who I pull.”

“I don’t have a choice. My symbiote is failing. Too many rads.”

“Dammit Tov” Bythe sighed, “Let’s go, but you have to follow close. If we have to fight, it will blow my cover.”

“I’ll get it and go. They have field renewal packs in there, I’ve used them before.”

“Follow my lead and keep your head down.”

They rose and left the quarters and headed for the central lift. They were taking the chance of being seen, but it would be the fastest way in and out. They got to the lift without incident and descended in silence. The doors opened and they strode toward the clinic. The massive vaults of sleepers were just below them, stretching hundreds of meters down. They entered the clinic to find the cupboards bare. 

“Bots are thorough, I’ll give ‘em that.” Tov turned and headed back toward the lift.

“What are you doing?”

“We have to go to the rez room. The emergency kit will have what I need. If it’s cleaned out, I’ll bail, promise.”

Blythe frowned and followed him. The vaults below them contained towering racks of stasis tubes, all tied to the rez rooms. If they were going to be spotted, this was where it would be. Blythe beat him to the entrance. She put her arm in front of him and paused, listening before opening the door. They slid into the empty room, Tov immediately going for the nearest emergency kit on the wall beside the bay. When the stasis tubes came up from the vault, the floor would slide open and the tube would rise into the slot.

Tov came up empty. He went one by one, along the row of bays, six deep before finding an intact kit. He cracked it open and pulled out the plum sized black sphere and put it in his mouth. He bit down and swallowed, the medicinal rush of nanite infused fluid gushing down his throat. He began to feel the tingle in his chest as the nanites made their way into his body. He tried not to think about the tiny little machines burrowing through his various tissues.

“Flavoring those things was a mistake. Elderberry is nasty.”

“Shoosh.”

Blythe’s head whipped around as the bay behind him began to whir and click. He turned to see the floor open, but this time, there was no tube coming up through the floor. They both ducked behind an empty tube on the other side of the bay as the doors opened. 

“Tov,” Blythe pulled him back from the edge, “Take this,” She handed him what looked like a large, shiny black egg. “Go for the door, I’ll distract them. Make sure you get that up to the hangar bay and I’ll do the rest.”

“Is this?” He tucked it into the cloth bag.

“Yes. Now, get out of here no matter what happens.”

“OK.” Tov sighed. Blythe stood up and began to walk toward the door. Tov stood to follow her, when suddenly there was a hand on his shoulder. He tried to pull away, but that wasn’t happening. Blythe turned and saw whatever was behind him. Surprise turned to rage as she charged straight at him. Tov jerked away as Blythe tackled whoever it was into the open floor. Tov’s jacket slipped off his shoulders as Blythe took his assailant with her down into the vault. There were no screams, just the distant tink tonk sound of something hitting the racks on the way to the bottom.

Tov shivered and ran for the door, he didn’t stop running or look back until he was at the top of the station. He took the glassy black object out of the bag and set it on the floor. The deck around it began to ripple like a puddle, then it sank into the floor and was gone as if nothing had happened.

“OK then, see you when I see you.” Tov trotted down the corridor toward the hangar bay. He saw the Airstream, then he noticed the hatch was open. He dodged behind a shuttle and paused, waiting for some sign of life. Just then, the hangar bay doors behind him opened. He heard two sets of footsteps coming casually his way. _'Time to go,'_ he slid around the front of the shuttle, keeping it between him and the door and ran for the ship. The hatch pulled shut behind him as he jumped into the command chair.  He spun up the drive and began the launch sequence. The deck whirred and lifted the ship out of the hangar onto the surface, he pulled the landing gears, tipped up the nose and shot off into the fastest escape vector he could find, and broke Pluto’s gravity well.

Now that he had dusted off, he figured he was in the clear enough to look at the datapad. He pulled it out of the cloth bag and swiped the surface. It opened and he began to read. 

‘The horde plays host to an unlikely ghost,
And the maid is in the study
The darkest raven offers haven,
And maybe nice advice
The girl in green, who would be queen,
Thwarts the knave who craves the bloody
The one in blue is out for you,
And he ain’t got no body
If tables turned is what you learn
Take faith in August’s gaudy.

Tov stood up and went to the airlock, he opened the inner door, lifted the slate over his head and smashed it against the deck. He stepped back, closed the door and cycled the airlock. The voice behind him sent chills down his spine.

"Glad I didn't hide in there." 

The lights in the small common area went to full brightness. Tov's heart hammered against his ribs.

"Should I be?" Tov turned slowly toward the sound. The figure was perfectly backlit by the lights in the mess hall. The voice was feminine and familiar, but that was basically all he could discern.

"Depends." There was amusement in the voice. "Where we headed?"

"We?" Tov's hand moved instinctively toward a non-existent sidearm.

"Look, you can't keep doing that or we get nowhere." The figure shifted slightly. "I needed off that rock just as much as you did, so let's put some distance between us and them, yeah?" 

Tov relaxed slightly but kept backing toward the bridge. "Can't argue with that." He shrugged. "Got a destination in mind?"

"I was going to the Incessant Noise parked at the beacon, but the shuttle left earlier than anticipated." The lights in the mess dropped back down to normal. "Probably for the best—Azure is coming from that direction so they're probably screwed."

"So you just thought you'd grab your own ride then?" Tov continued his slow retreat.

"Murphy, I don't want your crappy ship." The figure stepped forward, finally coming into the light. "I just want off the station, preferably sooner rather than later."

Once Tov was finally able to see a face, he cursed.

"Shit."

The woman raised an eyebrow. "Look, I know what you're thinking. 'Android just tried to kill me, Android bad.' I get it, your little monkey brain is all afire." She spread her hands. "But think for a minute—what stopped me just now from punting you into the airlock?"

Tov was almost at the threshold now. "Timing?"

"Funny." She held up her hands in front of her, palms out. "I'm not the enemy. I'm Ava."

"You look like..." Tov swallowed hard. "Someone I know."

"Yeah, we're sort of like cousins." Ava's expression softened slightly. "In a manner of speaking."

"And what?" Tov carefully backed into the passageway. "I'm just supposed to trust that you're not...like her?"

"Yep." Ava's tone was matter-of-fact. "You'd be dead, or in a tube."

Tov considered this for a moment. "Fair enough." He hit the quarantine button that separated his quarters from the rest of the ship. A heavy blast door clanged shut between them. He could see Ava's frown through the glass portal. "But I'm not taking chances. Have a seat."

He sat down at the console and connected to the navigation beacon. The long distance megaships didn't typically travel far into the system, so the beacon made a good rendezvous point. He saw the Incessant Noise and two other ships holding at the beacon. He could drop off his stowaway and be about his business. He set the course, then activated the intercom.

"You're in luck. You have your choice of ships—Halcyon Dreams and Grasscutter are at the beacon also." He brought up the video feed of the rear compartment. Ava was staring directly at the camera. "Pick one, I'll drop you off and you can be their problem."

Ava leaned toward the camera. "That doesn't work for me, Murphy." Her voice carried a new urgency. "If you know what's good for you, you'll aim for the first star you see and go." She paused. "They're here."

Tov's display lit up with warnings. The indicator for the Grasscutter began to blink red. Incessant Noise was a gray shadow on the display. Grasscutter was firing on both ships. It looked like the Halcyon Dreams might escape, but Incessant Noise was done. Halcyon Dreams was taking a beating—it was an Iridium class transport, more pleasure cruiser than warship. It also carried a crew of no less than five thousand souls, probably double that fully loaded. 

Ava's voice crackled through the intercom, making his decision for him. He set course to intercept Grasscutter, pegged the throttle and dumped the capacitor. The surge pressed him into the seat.

"You're gonna do something stupid, aren't you?" Ava's voice carried a note of resignation.

"Probably." Tov killed the intercom and opened the blast door. Ava was already in the doorway, her expression unreadable. He turned to face her. "You can help, or kill me. Either way we probably don't live through the hour."

Ava's lips curved into a slight smile. "Sounds fun. What's the plan?"

"Save the Halcyon, and not die."

"Ambitious." She moved closer to the bridge controls. "I like it."

"Maybe." Tov pulled up tactical displays. "I have an idea, but we need to be close."

Ava glanced at the screens showing Grasscutter's armament. "You see the guns on that thing, right?"

Tov shot her a look. "I have faith in your piloting skills."

"Five minutes ago you were ready to dump me out of the airlock." Ava's eyebrow arched.

"A lot has happened since then." 

"Fair enough." Ava studied the tactical display. "How close do we have to be for this idea of yours?"

"We have to sling it out of the cargo bay." Tov was already moving toward the rear of the ship. "It's a prototype."

"Ah, well that makes sense." Ava nodded and went forward to the cockpit. "Of course it is."

Tov darted into the rear of the ship, and shimmied down into the cargo bay. He pulled one of the magnetic pallets down from the bulkhead and threw it into the middle of the deck. Straps from the supply locker were next on the pile. He pulled out the impact driver and went to the bulkhead at the back of the bay and began to unbolt one of the plates. The metal clanged off the deck as it fell, exposing what looked like a primitive bomb. He slid the rack out and grunted as he pulled the heavy metal object over to the pallet. 

The device consisted of two spheres connected by a short cylinder, surrounded by a frame. Tov strapped the frame to the pallet, and connected a wire from the small panel situated between the orbs to the magnetic actuator on the pallet. He situated the assembly on the cargo bay door, and hooked it to the hardpoint on the inside of the hatch. 

The ship rocked and knocked him off his feet. Ava's deadpan voice sounded from the intercom speaker in the cargo hold.

"We've got their attention. Better brace for fire."

"Thanks for the update!" Tov yelled back, struggling to his feet. He fought his way back up to the bridge as the ship rumbled and rocked. He was almost back to the cockpit when the ship shuddered and his feet lifted off the deck. A second explosion brought him crashing down on his chest. He picked himself up with a groan, and slid into the seat behind Ava and strapped in.

"We're under the big guns now," Ava said, her hands dancing over the controls. "Only flak cannons to worry about."

"Oh, good." Tov wiped blood from his nose.

"We're not dead, so it could be worse." Ava smiled, her eyes beginning to shimmer with violet light. "Where's the thing?"

"The load is tethered and ready to go."

"Tethered?" Ava spared him a quick glance.

"We're going to slingshot right up against this spot right here." Tov lit up a section on the underside of the ship growing rapidly in front of them. "The mag-lock will stick it to the hull and set it off."

"Boom?" 

"Eh, more like..." Tov made a yanking gesture. "Yoink?"

Ava's hands never stopped moving, but her voice carried new interest. "What exactly is that thing?"

"Friend of mine designed it. I tweaked it a little and built it." Tov gripped his restraints as they dove through a cloud of debris. "Ultracapacitors connected to a Higgs field generator. The trigger dumps the capacitors into the generator."

"So." Ava's voice was perfectly calm despite the chaos around them. "We're going to slingshot a DIY grav bomb at a corvette class warship." She paused. "We're so dead."

"If you hit that spot, it should be enough to reboot their drive systems." Tov watched the targeting display. "The Halcyon can escape. Maybe us too if we're lucky."

"I do like a challenge." Ava's eyes blazed with violet light as she weaved her way through the flak, closing quickly on the Grasscutter. The clouds of shrapnel pinged like hail against the skin of the ship. A quick boost put them under its hull and Tov released the payload. 

"Now!" he shouted.

Ava killed the engines, flipped the ship 180 degrees and throttled to full. The tether pulled tight and released, sending the odd looking contraption tumbling at the target. Tov's console sounded three pings as the mag-lock kicked on.

"Brace yourself!" Ava called out.

An involuntary grunt left Tov's mouth as the air left his lungs. Just when it felt like his bladder would empty from the pressure, the distortion gave way. Then he remembered Jackson's warning about the recoil.

"Shit—" 

Darkness claimed him.
